# About Me

I'm a Computer Scientist, Philosophy Nerd, and Canine Fan.

I also play (and mostly DM) Dungeons and Dragons, and try to learn about every subject I can get my hands on.

I'm always looking for something new to learn, and someone to help by applying that learning.

Feel free to reach out!
