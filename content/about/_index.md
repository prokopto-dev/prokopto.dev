# About Me

I'm Courtney.

I am a student and Software Developer working in the Boston area.

I have, historically, worked in the Finance sector, especially for trading firms and associated companies.

I have a background in Philosophy, and an interest in the intersection of technology, philosophy, and a life well lived.

I enjoy researching and learning new things; while my ability to get excited can extend to almost any topic, I am most focused on AI (or Statistical Inference Engines and Models) research, and related topics.
